## 🌟 The Story

At Inovus Labs, we've issued hundreds of certificates over the years for workshops, bootcamps, and events. But in a world where designing a fake certificate is just a few clicks away, we needed a stronger system. This project brings real **trust** to every credential issued, using blockchain technology to make each certificate **verifiable, tamper-proof, and permanent**.

For more information on the project, check out the [blog post](https://blog.inovuslabs.org) detailing the journey of building this project.
